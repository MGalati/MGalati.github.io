# About Me

Bonjour, and welcome!

I am a **data scientist** and **translational researcher** specializing in the integration of computational methods with biological systems to advance precision medicine. I recently completed my **PhD in Biology** as part of the *i2TRON Doctoral Training Unit* at the **University of Luxembourg – Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB)**, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Reinhard Schneider and Dr. Venkata Satagopam.

## Research Focus

My research integrates **bioinformatics, systems biology, and multi-omics approaches** to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying complex medical conditions, including **peanut allergy, cancer, and inflammatory diseases**. I approach the life sciences as "sciences of exceptions": investigating unique biological phenomena and unexpected patterns to identify clinically relevant insights that advance precision medicine.

My work emphasizes **bench-to-clinic data integration**, combining experimental and computational methods to translate research findings into clinical applications. I strive to develop **reliable, robust, and efficient** analytical frameworks that support evidence-based patient care.

## Background

### From Curiosity to Computational Biology

My interest in biology emerged early and developed alongside a fascination with computers and technology. This dual passion led me naturally to **data science** during my graduate studies, where I discovered the potential of computational approaches to address biological questions. I got my **MSc in Bioinformatics and Biostructural Sciences**, gaining expertise in **statistics, machine learning, and programming**.

### Creative Foundations

Growing up in a creative household (my father worked as an *sign maker*, designing and fabricating signage, neon installations, and vinyl graphics) I developed an appreciation for craftsmanship, iterative problem-solving, and process optimization. These formative experiences continue to influence my approach to research and computational method development.

## Research Philosophy

- **Systematic inquiry**: I prioritize rigorous exploration of primary literature, technical documentation, and community knowledge bases to develop deep understanding of methodological foundations.
- **Methodological rigor**: My work emphasizes **robust, reliable, and efficient** analytical approaches with careful attention to reproducibility and validation.
- **Open science**: I advocate for **open-source tools** and transparent research practices that enable collaborative advancement of scientific knowledge.

---

## Community Engagement

I actively contribute to the scientific community through leadership roles in **ISCB-RSG Luxembourg** and previously in **JeBiF** (French-speaking Network of Young Bioinformaticians). I am committed to promoting **reproducible and responsible research practices** and fostering collaborative environments for knowledge exchange.

---

## Interests

- **Interdisciplinary learning**: I engage with diverse scientific perspectives and domains to broaden my understanding of complex biological systems.
- **Computational exploration**: I enjoy developing and optimizing analytical tools, pipelines, and workflows to address research challenges.
- **Multi-scale biology**: I am fascinated by the hierarchical organization of biological systems (from patients to organs, tissues, cells, molecular sequences, and three-dimensional protein structures) and the challenge of integrating information across these scales.
